How to execute python codes
----------------------------

1. Using .ipynb files [notebooks] : .ipynb stands for interactive Python Notebook 
   Notebook format
   cells
   - markdown cell: Use it for textual expressions / notes
   - code cell: Use it for running the codes

   To run .ipynb files
   - Jupyter notebook
   - VS code [install ipykernel]

   .ipynb files are usually great for learning and experimentation. You don't use it for production environment.
   The production environment usually runs python script

2. Using .py file [scripts]
   - You have to run it from the terminal (cmd prompt / powershell)
   - $ python xyz.py [$python3 xyz.py]

   These are used for production systems.


 Virtual Environment in Python
 -----------------------------

 - Often you will work on multiple python projects. Each of these projects will have different dependencies. 
 - project-1 : dependency on NumPy 1.24
 - project-2 : dependency on NumPy 2.0

 for each of the projects it is better to create a Virtual Environment, which will kind of act like a safe place to execute your codes. 
 Each virtual env will be isolated from other virtual env, so that the dependicies are intact and do not mess up the execution.

 Virtual environment
 - preinstalled files
 - python executer (interpreter)
 - Install libraries inside VE using "pip install <library name>"


 How to create a Virtual Environment
 -----------------------------------

 $ python -m venv <virtual_env_name>

 Activate the virtual environment
 --------------------------------

 [windows] 
 $ <virtual_env_name>\Scripts\activate

 [Mac/Linux]
 $ source <virtual_env>/bin/activate
